## Instalation
Use [jumbo-developer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jumbo-developer) package to create project! Project
must have specific structure but this core does NOT create that structure. 
You can create structure on your own (see docs) but you'll just waste time.

Install jumbo-developer tool via npm.
```
npm install jumbo-developer -g
```

Run jumbo-developer from console.

```
jumbo-developer
```

It will ask you for your project directory, so enter your project directory and press ENTER.
Then write 
```
create project
```
and you'll have base project (default from jumbo-developer template which you can change) in directory you specified earlier.

Go to your project directory and run application.
```
node app.js
```
Application will run on port 80 by default. You can change it in app.js.

See docs for more information.
